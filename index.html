            <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
            <p>
                A modern business uses technology. Bigger businesses use custom technology stacks, where every part of their process has a piece of technology to manage it, with every application linked and controlled. In small businesses, this is out of reach. These
                businesses use whatever they can afford, which is usually off the shelf software with very little integration. They must then deal with multiple systems, difficulty installing and managing software, and usually end up duplicating their
                data all over the different pieces of software. Technology in these businesses usually just adds complications, rather than simplifying the business processes. Our goal is to fix that
            </p>
            <p>
                Technology should be helpful. When a business turns to technology as a solution, it should provide a real advantage over doing things manually, otherwise, why not stick to pen and paper? I think the best way to do this, is by making powerful open-source
                software easy to use. Most needs that businesses have can be filled by free open-source software, that is powerful enough to handle anything they need. The problem with this software is that it usually takes a considerable amount of work
                to set this software up, and the actual usage of it can be finnicky. It is just not worth it for a lot of small businesses
            </p>
            <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
            <p>
                The goal of this service is to simplify that by creating a single interface for these open-source services at minimal cost, and maximum ease of use. A small business owner should be able to download the project, run the setup file, select what kind of
                business they have, and then the appropriate open-source software will download and get setup, ready for use.
            </p>

            <p>
                The end user can access the service through a custom webapp that interfaces with a Flask API that controls all the different applications. The project should be designed with expansion in mind, which means that it will be easy to add new products and
                custom interfaces for businesses that are not covered by the options available by default. For those businesses, when they find the application which handles what they need, it can be installed easily just by dropping the appropriate files
                into the install folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way this will be achieved will be in two parts. The User Interface will be a webapp. This is important, as some preliminary market research suggested that it is crucial that business apps can accessed from many different devices, particularly mobile
                devices. This web app will interface with a Flask server running a restful API. The applications will be directly controlled by the Flask server, using an API where one is available, and using Selenium to access the GUI of the application
                where one is not.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the program installs, you can change the desired use case. For example, it could be installed for use with a small home contractor, or a teacher, or in an office environment. Each of these will have a separate webapp that provides an interface to
                the specific services that will be used for that type of business. Each webapp will access the appropriate parts of the API to install the necessary services and set them up

                I am currently working on building the system specifically for self-employed construction contractors, as it was a plasterer/tiler who helped me to pinpoint the services that they needed. I need to have my API allow files to be created and uploaded to
                Nextcloud, create invoices in Invoice Ninja, and manage customers between the two. All of this should be managed through a single frontend, which will display the information of both services grouped by customer. It should allow for the
                data to be filtered, searched, and backed up. It should also be able to output data to a calendar event for the userâ€™s calendar app of choice. In its current state, the API allows for the install and setup of the services Nextcloud and
                Invoice Ninja. These services will form the backbone for the product, as managing finances and storing documents are abilities that almost every business will need. I have also began building the custom UI for this, though it currently
                is not full linked to the API. The API is expandable, so I can add additional applications and new abilities to existing applications relatively easily
