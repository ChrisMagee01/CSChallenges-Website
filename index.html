                Finances and Files are the most difficult things for a business to keep track of.
                Luckily,Open Source software is trying to make that easier.

                Nextcloud is similar to Dropbox,
                but it is entirely hosted on your own server, making sure that your files stay confidential.
                It also provides features like collaborating on documents, chat and even allows calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Invoice Ninja allows you to send invoices, handle expenses and a lot more. Together, they
                can form the backbone of any business infrastructure.

                In this tutorial, you will learn how
                to set up both inside of Docker containers on a Ubuntu server, and have a homepage which
                can direct you between the two using Apache
            </p>

            <a id="Docker">
                <h3>Install Docker</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The first thing you need to do is to install Docker. This part of the tutorial is
                almost identical to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">official Docker
                    setup guide</a>, so you can follow it there if you would prefer. Both of the services will
                run inside of Docker containers, so you can’t run them until it fully setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure there are no older versions installed before you begin:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you wil need to run:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                sudo apt update
            </p>
            <p>
                This refreshes your computers list of packages it can install. We do it before installing
                things just to make sure we always get the most up to date version
            </p>
            <p>
                Docker needs us to be able to use apt over https, so we need to install some packages to
                allow that before we can start installing Docker
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                sudo apt install \<br />
                apt-transport-https \<br />
                ca-certificates \<br />
                curl \<br />
                gnupg-agent \<br />
                software-properties-common
            </p>
            <p>Now add Docker's GPG key to your system:</p>
            <p class="code">
                curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use the stable version of docker, which means it is less likely to break,
                but also isn’t as up to date as the test or nightly versions. We add the repository for it like this:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                sudo add-apt-repository \<br />
                "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \<br />
                $(lsb_release -cs) \<br />
                stable"
            </p>
            <p>
                And now we can finally install Docker itself:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                sudo apt update<br />
                sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
            </p>

            <a id="Nextcloud">
                <h3>Install Nextcloud</h3>
                <p>
                    Nextcloud installation is really simple when you have Docker. You run a single command,
                    and it downloads the Nextcloud image for Docker, runs it, and exposes a port so you can access it.
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --restart unless-stopped nextcloud
                </p>
            </a>
