                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            </a>
            <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
            <p>
                A modern business uses technology. Bigger businesses use custom technology stacks, where every part of
                their process has a piece of technology to manage it, with every application linked and controlled. In
                small businesses, this is out of reach. These
                businesses use whatever they can afford, which is usually off the shelf software with very little
                integration. They must then deal with multiple systems, difficulty installing and managing software, and
                usually end up duplicating their
                data all over the different pieces of software. Technology in these businesses usually just adds
                complications, rather than simplifying the business processes. Our goal is to fix that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technology should be helpful. When a business turns to technology as a solution, it should provide a
                real advantage over doing things manually, otherwise, why not stick to pen and paper? I think the best
                way to do this, is by making powerful open-source
                software easy to use. Most needs that businesses have can be filled by free open-source software, that
                is powerful enough to handle anything they need. The problem with this software is that it usually takes
                a considerable amount of work
                to set up, and the actual usage of it can be finnicky. It is just not worth it for a lot
                of small businesses.
            </p>
            <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
            <p>
                The goal of this service is to simplify that by creating a single interface for these open-source
                services at minimal cost, and maximum ease of use. A small business owner should be able to download the
                project, run the setup file, select what kind of
                business they have, and then the appropriate open-source software will download and get setup, ready for
                use.
            </p>
            <a id="Implementation">
                <h3>THE IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                The end user can access the service through a custom webapp that interfaces with a Flask API that
                controls all the different applications. The project should be designed with expansion in mind, which
                means that it will be easy to add new products and
                custom interfaces for businesses that are not covered by the options available by default. For those
                businesses, when they find the application which handles what they need, it can be installed easily just
                by dropping the appropriate files
                into the install folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will be achieved in two parts. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The User Interface will be a webapp. This is
                    important, as some preliminary market research suggested that it is crucial that business apps can
                    accessed from many different devices, particularly mobile
                    devices.</li>
                <li> This web app will interface with a Flask server running a restful API. The applications will be
                    directly controlled by the Flask server, using an API where one is available, and using Selenium to
                    access the GUI of the application
                    where one is not.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                When the program installs, you can change the desired use case. For example, it could be installed
                for use with a small home contractor, or a teacher, or in an office environment. Each of these will have
                a separate webapp that provides an interface to the specific services that will be used for that type of
                business. Each webapp will access the appropriate parts of the API to install the necessary services and
                set them up
            </p>
            <p>
                The services I have used to begin with are Invoice Ninja and Nextcloud. Invoice Ninja allows for easy
                management of business finances, while Nextcloud lets the user store files on the server, with a Dropbox
                like interface. I have chosen these because I think almost any business will need these features.
                Finances can be one of the most difficult areas for small businesses to manage, and also one of the most
                costly to have an error with. Simple software like Invoice Ninja should help with this, especially once
                there is a custom interface which removes some of the complexities. Nextcloud on the other hand, should
                provide an easy way to store all of the files that a business will need. In the home contractor use case
                for example, Nextcloud will store the documents created when generating quotes and plans. This could be
                accomplished through something like an FTP server, but I feel the added functionality of Nextcloud make
                it worth it, as it can allow for things like collaboration and messaging capabilities.
            </p>
            <a id="Technical">
                <h3>TECHNICAL DETAILS</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                I am currently working on building the system specifically for self-employed construction contractors,
                as it was a plasterer/tiler who helped me to pinpoint the services that they needed. I need to have my
                API allow files to be created and uploaded to Nextcloud, create invoices in Invoice Ninja, and manage
                customers between the two. All of this should be managed through a single frontend, which will display
                the information of both services grouped by customer. It should allow for the data to be filtered,
                searched, and backed up. It should also be able to output data to a calendar event for the userâ€™s
                calendar app of choice. In its current state, the API allows for the install and setup of the services
                Nextcloud and Invoice Ninja. These services will form the backbone for the product, as managing finances
                and storing documents are abilities that almost every business will need. I have also began building the
                custom UI for this, though it currently is not full linked to the API. The API is expandable, so I can
                add additional applications and new abilities to existing applications relatively easily
            </p>

            <a id="Prerequisites">
                <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Docker</h5>
                        Docker is a system for running different apps in containers. This keeps them isolated from each
                        other without using as much resources as running them in a virtual machine would, which requires
                        more overheads such as the complete OS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Docker Compose</h5>
                        A way to coordinate multiple docker containers and run them together as a single system. I
                        considered setting up all of the services in the same docker-compose group, but this would have
                        eliminated some of the modularity of the project. It is used now for services which require
                        multiple parts, such as a database or a webserver, on top of the app itself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Flask</h5>
                        A lightweight python web server. It can respond to HTTP requests and trigger responses within
                        our python code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Pyselenium</h5>
                        A way to use Selenium in Python. Selenium is a program which allows automating features that
                        would normally require a user within a web browser. We will use it to fill in forms and automate
                        setup whenever we cannot control the service directly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Gekkodriver, a Selenium driver for Firefox</h5>
                        Selenium requires a web driver to use with a browser. Each browser has a different driver. I
                        chose Firefox, as it is installed by default on Ubuntu machines and therefore does not need
                        additional setup for the average user.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The end user of the project is not expected to have any technical knowledge, and so installing these
                    prerequisites could be difficult for them. To combat this, I have created a script which should
                    download all of them, and then download the project itself, before launching the web server. This
                    file can be downloaded

                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    For those who would prefer to download it manually, you can install the prerequisites above, and
                    then clone the repo from <a href="https://github.com/ChrisMagee01/CSChallenges-Jackalope">here</a>
                </p>

                <a id="Expansion">
                    <h3>EXPANDING THE PROJECT</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before beginning development, it will be helpful to understand the current structure of the
                        project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The key part is the main Flask webserver. This is stored in the root of the project as
                        flaskAPI.py. This is the program that we will actually run when using our project, as it manages
                        everything else. We do this by setting the FLASK_APP environment variable and then running flask
                        run from within the directory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The flaskAPI.py file contains only a single line of code: From API import app This line gets the
                        app variable from within the API module. This variable is the Flask instance that makes up our
                        webserver. It is created in ./API/__init__.py. That file then imports the routes of the project.
                        In the routes file, we define all of our API endpoints using the function decorator
                        @app.route(â€˜PATH HEREâ€™). The function immediately after that decorator will run whenever the
                        flask webserver receives a request to the path in the decorator. Each of these functions will
                        call a function inside the Services package, which has a module for each service that we will
                        install. Currently, the only implemented methods are the setup and install methods, but this can
                        be easily expanded. For code which requires multiple services to work together, consider
                        creating a new file, to maintain the simplicity inside of the routes file. This organisation
                        should help ensure that API can continue to grow without becoming overly complex inside of the
                        main file.
                    </p>

                    <a id="Example">
                        <h3>EXAMPLE SERVICE</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        As the system is supposed to be modular, and easy to add new services to, I felt it would be
                        beneficial to walk through the steps I went through when adding a process:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Manually install on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 installation. The clean install is to make sure I
                            have not missed any small dependencies that I may already have installed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Put commands above into Python script using Python subprocess module
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Run script for testing
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        After this, I began to work out the setup process. I decided to use Selenium
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Go through process manually, recording all data that needs to be entered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create pyselenium script to do the same thing
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Debug script
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the commands, this third step could take some time. Selenium sees what a human would see
                        when accessing the page, and this can cause issues. For example, the auto page scroll to next
                        element would not work on Invoice Ninja, because the pageâ€™s cookie popup left behind an
                        invisible box covering the very bottom of the page when dismissed, and this could not be clicked
                        through. The solution to this was to scroll the page by a set amount in order to move it above the layer
                    </p>
                    <p>It is then time to place these functions into the API.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Add a file inside of the services folder with the scripts above as functions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add entries to the routes file which call these functions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            test from start to finish
                        </li>
                    </ol>
