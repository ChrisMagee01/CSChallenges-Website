                PART 1 - INSTALLING NEXTCLOUD AND INVOICE NINJA USING DOCKER
            </h3>

            <p>In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to manually install Nextcloud and Invoice Ninja
                using Docker. This will be the basis of the tech stack we will use for future automation, so it will
                be useful to learn more about the installation process</p>

            <h3>
                PART 2 - AUTOMATING A TECH STACK WITH A FLASK API
            </h3>
            <p>
                This will teach you how to setup a Flask API which can automatically setup and install Nextcloud and
                Invoice Ninja. The skills here could be used to automate almost any process. You will also learn how
                to upload your project to GitHub and write an installation script which will install your project
                and all it's prerequisites when you run it
